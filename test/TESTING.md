# Testing overview

## Unit tests

```bash
pnpm test:unit
```

These include pure function tests, react hook tests and component tests.

They use [MSW](https://mswjs.io/) to intercept any network call.

Any module/hook that uses onchain calls should be injected via a context provider and we should mock its public API.

## Integration (onchain) tests

```bash
pnpm test:integration
```

These are tests over any module/hook that uses onchain calls. vitest finds them by their special filename ***.integration.spec.***.

We use a separate vitest configuration for these onchain tests that run against an [anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/) fork.

## E2E tests

TBD.

## Notes

### Next 13 and testing

Next 13 and RSC are very new and testing is not yet mature enough so the testing strategy above could change when they finally release better testing tools/recommendations.

- [Support Next.js 13 (App directory)](https://github.com/mswjs/msw/issues/1644)

### Watchers

- vitests are run in watch mode by default.
- next currently uses a global webpack watcher for HMR.
- It is possible that vitest tests are rerun by next watcher if you have it running in another tab.

### Testing strategy: Component vs Hook tests

There are many different testing strategies and flavours by different authors but this is an extended one in frontend:

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.

That means that the more we test features by interacting with the component's UI the better. However, our context is special because we normally have complex logic with many edge cases that makes it challenging and cumbersome to tests from the UI. A general advise would be extracting that logic to hook/s so that we can have tests that are faster and simpler to code, understand and maintain. Then leave component tests for the happy paths.

From [react hooks testing library](https://react-hooks-testing-library.com/#the-solution):

> When to test hooks instead of components
> You have a complex hook that is difficult to test through component interactions ðŸ‘ˆ We will have this scenario in many cases
