/**
 * AddLiquidityHandler is an interface that defines the methods that must be implemented by a handler.
 * They take standard inputs from the UI and return frontend standardised outputs.
 *
 * SDK handlers:
 * - Default handlers will interact with the SDK to query and build the call data for the transaction
 * - They store the response of the last query execution inside the handler instance so it can be used later by buildAddLiquidityCallData
 * - Each time queryAddLiquidity is called they update that internal state
 *
 * Edge-case handlers:
 * - Edge case handlers (e.g. Twamm handler) will not interact with the SDK
 * - They do not store the response of a SDK query but could store other state related to the edge-case implementation
