  This script is a workaround to generate a manifest.json file that is compatible with Safe Apps.
  Using nextjs manifest.ts does not work because:
  1) nextjs is using manifest.webmanifest instead of manifest.json (not supported by Safe Apps)
  2) nextjs only supports manifest.ts in the root folder but we also need it in /public/pools
  More info:
  https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/manifest#generate-a-manifest-file
