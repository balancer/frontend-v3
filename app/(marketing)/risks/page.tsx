                <em>
                  There are many inherent risks developers accept when working in DeFi and using the
                  Balancer Protocol. This page aims to summarize the top risks to help you with your
                  risk decisions. It is important to note that this list is not exhaustive, and
                  there may be additional risks not explicitly mentioned here. As the risk
                  environment is fluid, we expect to periodically update this summary.

                General risks

                Smart contract risk
              </h4>
              <p>
                Smart contract risk is a general risk when using DeFi protocols, including Balancer.
                Smart contracts are self-executing pieces of code that run on certain blockchains,
                like Ethereum. Although they are designed to be secure, they can be vulnerable to
                bugs and exploits.
              </p>
              <p>
                If there is a flaw in the smart contract code, it can be exploited by attackers to
                steal funds from the protocol. This can result in the loss of funds for liquidity
                providers and swappers who are using the protocol. Smart contract risk is a major
                risk for all DeFi users, and it is important to carefully evaluate the security of
                the protocols before using them.
              </p>
              <h5>The Balancer Vault</h5>
              <p>
                The main architectural change between Balancer V1 and Balancer V2 is the transition
                to&nbsp;a single vault that holds and manages all the assets added by all Balancer
                pools. This separates the AMM logic from the token management and accounting. Token
                management/accounting is done by the vault while the AMM logic is individual to each
                pool. This provides many advantages, including flexibility and gas efficiency.
              </p>
              <p>
                One critique of this approach is that the Balancer Vault could be a single point of
                failure—i.e. hack the vault, get all the tokens of the protocol. This Balancer Vault
                architecture was heavily audited prior to launch and has now been battle-tested
                since May 2021, securing over $3b. It has also been forked by other teams across
                different networks, including Beethoven X on Fantom, without issue.
              </p>
              <h5>How does Balancer work to mitigate this risk?</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Development teams have engaged with top tier smart contract auditing firms to
                  identify and fix bugs before deployment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The core of Balancer smart contracts are immutable and do not use proxies or other
                  upgrade mechanisms. Note: Within DeFI, upgradable contracts are a major way
                  exploits have been introduced.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In addition, Balancer has a bug bounty program via{' '}
                  <a href="https://immunefi.com/bounty/balancer/">Immunefi</a> to attract white-hat
                  hackers to responsibly disclose any bugs. Rewards are distributed based on threat
                  level—for critical smart contract vulnerabilities, there is a minimum reward of
                  250 ETH and a maximum reward of 1,000 ETH.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>How can LPs mitigate this risk?</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  LPs should carefully research and use DeFi protocols that are battle-tested with a
                  history of functioning as intended, while securing large amounts of assets.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To diversify risk, LPs may consider not placing all their tokens into a single
                  protocol.
                </li>

              <h4>Mechanism / Economic risk</h4>
              <p>
                An mechanism or economic exploit of a DeFi protocol occurs when an attacker is able
                to manipulate the economic incentives of the protocol to their advantage, resulting
                in a loss of funds for other participants. This can happen even when there are no
                smart contract bugs or other unintended logic errors.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, an attacker could take advantage of a liquidity pool&apos;s pricing
                mechanism to intentionally cause the price of an asset to deviate from its true
                value, allowing them to buy or sell that asset at a profit.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, the composable nature of DeFi means that a pool on Balancer may contain
                tokens that may be manipulated by an attacker on a third party protocol, which
                further increases risk.
              </p>
              <p>These types of economic exploits are difficult to detect and prevent.</p>

              <ul>

                  Balancer strives to deliver careful economic modeling, rigorous mechanism design,

              <h4>Toxic pool token risk</h4>
              <p>
                A liquidity pool is only as good as its weakest token. This is because liquidity
                pools typically sell the winners (tokens moving up in price) and accumulate the
                losers (tokens moving down in price). If a pool contains a toxic token, the value of
                the BPT (LP tokens) of the liquidity pool could go to zero. This is the case even if
                the other pool tokens remain good and would otherwise not be affected.
              </p>
              <p>
                A toxic token could be seeded into a liquidity pool by a malicious pool creator or
                an otherwise good token could become toxic (similar to Terra&rsquo;s stablecoin{' '}
                <code>UST</code>).

                Rebasing tokens
              </h5>
              <p>
                Rebasing tokens are a type of cryptocurrency that adjusts the supply of the token
                based on a predetermined formula. This formula is usually designed to keep the price
                of the token stable relative to some external metric, such as the price of a
                particular asset or a specific index. When the external metric changes, the token
                supply is adjusted, which in turn affects the price of the token.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, if a rebasing token is designed to maintain a price of $1 per token and
                the price of the external asset goes up by 10%, the token supply would decrease by
                10% to maintain the $1 price point. Similarly, if the external asset price goes down
                by 10%, the token supply would increase by 10%.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some examples of rebasing tokens include <code>stETH</code> and
                <code>AMPL</code>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, rebasing tokens generally don&rsquo;t work well in liquidity pools
                since LPs may suffer losses when rebasing occurs.
              </p>

              <h5>How does Balancer mitigate these risks?</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Since the Balancer protocol is permissionless, anyone can create a liquidity pool
                  composed of any ERC-20 token. This makes this type of risk difficult to mitigate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Balancer App UI may be updated to exclude blacklisted tokens and pools but LPs
                  should not rely on this.
                </li>

                  Instead of including tokens which rebase, new DeFi liquidity pool compatible

                DeFi composability risks
              </h4>
              <p>
                DeFi composability refers to the ability of different DeFi protocols and
                applications to work together seamlessly in endless combinations, allowing
                developers to create more complex financial transactions and applications. This is
                sometimes referred to as DeFi lego building blocks, since they can be combined and
                connected to created interesting new structures and applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                While composability offers many benefits, layering on protocols and applications on
                top of each other comes with additional risks. For example, risks get compounded
                when multiple protocols are composed together, as a vulnerability in one contract
                could impact others. The interconnectivity of DeFi protocols can amplify risks,
                turning isolated incidents into systemic threats. For example, if a major protocol
                fails or suffers from an exploit, it could lead to a domino effect, impacting other
                protocols and users in the ecosystem.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other risks could cascade if a protocol within a composability stack has a liquidity
                crisis, an unfavorable governance decision or regulatory outcome.

                Balancer currently uses off-chain voting mechanisms to signal the will of veBAL

                <li>
                  The Multisig does&nbsp;not&nbsp;have custody of, nor control over, funds from
                  liquidity providers locked inside Balancer Protocol contracts. Balancer V2 was
                  designed so that even if a multisig goes rogue, all the liquidity is safe and can
                  be withdrawn by their rightful owners.

              </h4>
              <p>
                A Flash Loan is a type of loan where a user borrows assets with no upfront
                collateral and returns the borrowed assets within the same blockchain transaction.
                Flash Loans use smart contracts which requires that a borrower repays the loan
                before the transaction ends. They are typically used for arbitrage opportunities,
                collateral swaps and to lower transaction fees, across potentially multiple
                protocols. It&rsquo;s a powerful new financial primitive, native to DeFi.

              <p>Flash Loans may be used on Balancer and interact with the Balancer Vault.</p>
              <p>
                While Flash Loans offer many benefits, they also comes with certain risks. Flash
                Loans have also been used for multiple DeFi exploits resulting in losses worth
                millions of dollars. Flash Loan exploits are relatively new with the full range of
                attack surfaces still being discovered.

                Mutable pool attributes
              </h4>
              <p>
                Balancer is a flexible AMM that allows people to create different types of liquidity
                pools, including those with immutable and/or mutable pool attributes.
              </p>
              <p>
                For pools with immutable attributes, LPs can be assured that the rules are designed
                so they cannot change once they have provided liquidity since no pool attribute
                should be changed by anyone at any time.
              </p>
              <p>For pools with mutable attributes, LPs should understand:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Which attributes can change
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Certain attributes being mutable provide more risk than others. For example,
                      changing the swap fee percentage is generally viewed as less risky than the
                      ability to change the constituent tokens of a pool, since a malicious editor
                      could introduce a toxic pool token.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      On Balancer pools, if an attribute is editable, the address that can make the
                      edit is also specified. The two most common parties that are set to be able to
                      change pool attributes are either the Pool Owner or Balancer Governance.
                    </li>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  For known pool types, the Balancer App UI transparently displays pool attributes
                  and specifies if it is editable and if so, by whom.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Balancer Managed Pools are designed to have mutable attributes that can be changed
                  by the Pool Owner. For certain &lsquo;dangerous operations&rsquo;, there are
                  &lsquo;timelock delays&rsquo; which give LPs a period to review the proposed
                  changes and withdraw funds if they do not agree with the change. In addition, Pool
                  Controllers can set a guardian who has the ability to veto a proposed change from
                  the Pool Owner if they believe it to be a malicious change or a mistake.

              <h5>How can LPs mitigate this risk?</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  LPs should check to see the edibility of pool attributes and understand who can
                  authorize any changes.

                Loss of funds on join/exit of a pool
              </h4>
              <h5>Due to high price impact</h5>
              <p>
                When joining a pool, LPs should be aware of the price impact from adding tokens to
                the pool. In general, adding liquidity in proportional amounts to the token weights
                of the pool incur low price impact. Adding custom token amounts (non-proportionally)
                causes the internal prices of the pool to change, as if you were swapping tokens.
                The higher the price impact the more you&apos;ll spend in swap fees.
              </p>
              <h5>Due to slippage</h5>
              <p>
                LPs should also consider the effect of slippage when adding liquidity to a pool.
                Slippage occurs when market conditions change between the time your order is
                submitted and the time it gets executed on Ethereum. Slippage tolerance is the
                maximum change in price you are willing to accept.
              </p>
              <p>
                Slippage tolerance is a setting in both the Add/Remove liquidity flows on the
                Balancer App UI. Setting a low slippage tolerance protects you from front-running
                bots and miner extractable value (MEV).
              </p>
              <h5>Due to high Gas fees</h5>
              <p>
                Gas on the Ethereum network refers to the unit that measures the amount of
                computational effort required to execute specific operations. Gas fees in Ethereum
                are the transaction costs users pay to have their transactions processed and
                validated by the network&apos;s miners. Gas fees vary depending on network
                congestion, transaction complexity, and the amount of gas a user is willing to pay.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gas fees can be particularly high during periods of network congestion. As a result,
                LPs might face increased costs when adding or removing liquidity, making adjustments
                to their positions, or claiming liquidity mining incentives. If the gas fees are
                higher than the returns they get from providing liquidity, LPs may end up with a net
                loss.

                  The Balancer Smart Order router is used to route liquidity efficiently via pools

                  user&rsquo;s from executing a transaction where they would otherwise get rekt.

                Impermanent loss
              </h4>
              <p>
                Impermanent loss is a risk that liquidity providers (LPs) face when providing
                liquidity to an automated market maker (AMM) like Balancer. It is the difference
                between the value of holding assets in a pool versus holding them outside of the
                pool.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the price of the assets in the pool changes, LPs may experience a loss compared
                to holding the assets outside of the pool. This can happen because the AMM algorithm
                rebalances the pool to maintain a constant ratio of the assets in the pool. If the
                price of one asset increases, the algorithm will sell some of that asset and buy
                more of the other asset to maintain the ratio. This means that LPs will sell the
                asset that is increasing in price and buy the asset that is decreasing in price,
                resulting in a loss.
              </p>
              <p>
                This risk is particularly relevant for pools with volatile assets where token prices
                are likely diverge over time.
              </p>
              <h5>How does Balancer work to mitigate this risk?</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  All AMMs either have impermanent loss or reduced yield to LPs. Balancer aims to
                  make its pools as capital efficient as possible so that the yield LPs make is more
                  likely to exceed any impermanent loss.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Balancer protocol supports unbalanced pools which LPs can use to reduce
                  impermanent loss. For example, there is lower impermanent loss in an 80/20 pool
                  (or any other unbalanced pools) versus a 50/50 pool with the same underlying
                  tokens.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Note: Some ecosystem developers are building on top of Balancer to create novel
                  pools, including Managed Pools, with rebalancing algorithms designed to minimize
                  impermanent loss.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>How can LPs mitigate this risk?</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  LPs should consider the risk of impermanent risk carefully before providing
                  liquidity to a Balancer pool.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The longer an LP holds their position, the more likely it is that their yield from
                  swap fees offset and exceed any impermanent loss, assuming the price divergence of
                  the token prices isn&rsquo;t extreme.
                </li>
                <li>
                  LPs may consider providing liquidity into pools with less likelihood of token
                  price divergence. For example, stable pools or boosted pools.
                </li>
                <li>
                  LP&rsquo;s should consider providing liquidity in unbalanced pools, like 80/20
                  pools which result in less impermanent loss versus a 50/50 pool with the same
                  underlying tokens.

              <p>
                DeFi users, including liquidity providers and swappers, typically interact with
                front-end user interfaces to interact with a protocol&rsquo;s smart contracts. An
                example is the app.balancer.fi front-end UI instance which interacts with Balancer
                Protocol smart contracts.

                  Since the Balancer smart contracts can be interacted with by any front-end UI,

                  The developers of the Balancer App UI have provided instructions on how to clone

                The regulatory frameworks applicable to blockchain transactions in connection with

                    Stablecoins are tokens whose value is intended to be pegged or tied to that of
                    another asset, which could be a currency, commodity or financial instrument.
                    There are many types of stablecoins, some are risky than others depending on
                    product design including evidence of reserves to support the peg in times of
                    stress. Some example types of stablecoins include:

                    Depegging occurs when a stablecoin losses its peg to the target asset. In stable
                    pools, if a stablecoin depegs, LPs may incurs losses. This is because liquidity
                    pools typically sell the winners (tokens moving up in price) and accumulate the
                    losers (tokens moving down in price). In the case of a USD-pegged stable pool,
                    if an asset permanently loses it&rsquo;s peg to $1 and goes down in value, the
                    pool will sell any pegged assets and accumulate the asset which has lost
                    it&rsquo;s peg, leading to an overall loss of funds for LPs.

                      Rate Providers are contracts that provide an exchange rate between two assets.
                      These exchange rates can come from any on-chain source, whether that may be an

                    <h6>Oracle risk</h6>
                    <p>
                      Oracles are data providers which supply external information to smart
                      contracts. Oracles, like Chainlink, may be used to source exchange rates
                      between pool tokens for a rate provider in Balancer MetaStable pools. The
                      risks of using Oracles to supply exchange rates include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Data accuracy: Oracles must provide accurate data for DeFi applications to
                        function correctly. Inaccurate data can cause significant issues, such as
                        incorrect pricing or faulty execution of smart contracts.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Data availability: If an oracle experiences downtime or fails to update its
                        data feed, the DeFi applications relying on it might not function correctly
                        or become temporarily unusable, leading to potential losses for users.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Latency: The time it takes for an oracle to fetch, process, and transmit
                        data to a smart contract can impact the performance and efficiency of DeFi
                        applications. High latency could lead to outdated data or missed
                        opportunities.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Oracle manipulation: Bad actors might attempt to manipulate an oracle&apos;s
                        data feed to influence the outcome of a smart contract or profit from price
                        discrepancies. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as
                        liquidations, loss of funds, or arbitrage opportunities for attackers.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Centralization risk: If an oracle relies on a centralized data source or a
                        small number of data providers, it becomes a single point of failure. This
                        centralization goes against the core principles of decentralization in the
                        DeFi ecosystem and exposes the system to potential manipulation or downtime.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Exploitation of vulnerabilities: Oracles themselves can have security
                        vulnerabilities, which, if exploited, can compromise the entire DeFi system
                        relying on them.
                      </li>

                    <h6>Rate provider cross-chain bridge risk</h6>
                    <p>
                      Pools may use rate providers that are bridged between blockchain networks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For example, some pools on Polygon zkEVM use a rate provider that is bridged
                      from Ethereum Mainnet via the Layer Zero (an omnichain messaging service). In
                      these pools, LPs are exposed to risk of significant losses if an incorrect
                      rate is received via the omnichain messaging service.

                    Typically, only 10% or less of the liquidity deposited into an AMM pool is being
                    utilized by traders because the trade sizes are much smaller than the available
                    liquidity. Boosted Pools allow the remaining portion of liquidity to be sent to
                    lending protocols where the liquidity can earn additional yield for accepting
                    inherent risks.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Boosted Pools are designed to allow for greater capital efficiency, deeper
                      liquidity, and increased yield for Liquidity Providers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For traders, Boosted Pools are a cheaper entry/exit into lending protocols
                      like Aave.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Boosted Pools increase the opportunity for LPs to gain exposure to a wide
                      variety of yield increases from multiple yield protocols.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <h5>Third party lending platform risk exposure (DeFi composability risk)</h5>
                  <p>
                    Since boosted pools deposit excess liquidity into lending protocols, like Aave,
                    to generate yield, LPs must fully understand the risks of the underlying lending
                    protocol since a portion of their funds will be exposed to the risks of that
                    protocol. Some of the risks of the underlying lending protocol may include smart
                    contract bugs, economic attack vulnerabilities and counterparty risk from the
                    protocol&rsquo;s borrowers. Lending platforms may also use{' '}

                    which face additional risks (described above).
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Also note, some Boosted pools, like those by Tetu and Idle may use strategies
                    that utilize multiple yield protocols in order to maximize yield. Since these
                    strategies may change exposure to the underlying yield protocols at any time,
                    LPs must accept the risk that the protocol utilizing these strategies carefully
                    vets all third party protocols to reduce composability risks.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    If the underlying lending protocol were to get hacked, LPs in a boosted pool
                    that deposits liquidity in that protocol could lose funds.

                  <p>
                    Sidechains and Layer 2 networks can offer advantages over Ethereum Mainnet, like
                    faster transaction times and lower fees. However, they come with their own set
                    of risks and trade-offs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, sidechains and Layer 2 networks often have a different security
                    models. They may rely on a smaller set of validators or different consensus
                    mechanisms, which could potentially make them more susceptible to attacks or
                    centralization risks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition, there are bridging risks when user&rsquo;s move funds between
                    networks. Asset bridges rely on smart contracts to facilitate transfers between
                    Ethereum Mainnet and Layer 2/sidechains. These contracts may have
                    vulnerabilities, which could expose users&apos; funds to risks during the
                    bridging process.

                <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon PoS</a> is Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
                sidechain scaling solution that runs in parallel to Ethereum Mainnet. Its validators
                are solely responsible for validating Polygon transactions. It does not derive
                security from Ethereum Mainnet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Polygon is subject to the same risks of other PoS chains. In particular, it has a
                smaller pool of capital and validator set to gain consensus compared to Ethereum
                Mainnet.

                completely independent from the Ethereum blockchain. It&apos;s actually a

                A Subnet is a sovereign network which defines its own rules regarding its membership
                and token economics. The security of assets within a specific subnet is directly
                tied to the security and integrity of its validators.{' '}
