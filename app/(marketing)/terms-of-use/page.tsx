              “us” refers to the Balancer Foundation and its subsidiary Balancer OpCo Limited)

              (collectively “the Site”) we own and administer, at times in conjunction with others,
              which provides the ability to access the decentralized Balancer Protocol.
              Additionally, you can access the Balancer Protocol through third-party web or mobile
              interfaces. These Terms apply to you (“You” or “you”) as a user of our Site including

            <h2>2. Site</h2>
            <p>
              As part of the Site, Balancer provides access to a decentralized finance application
              (“Application” or “Balancer Protocol app”) on the Ethereum blockchain, that allows
              swappers or liquidity providers of Ethereum assets (“Cryptocurrency Assets”) to
              transact using smart contracts (“Smart Contracts”). Use of the Balancer Protocol may
              require that you pay a fee, such as gas charges on the Ethereum network to perform a
              transaction. You acknowledge and agree that Balancer has no control over any
              activities, transactions, the method of payment of any transactions, or any actual
              processing of payments of transactions. You must ensure that you have a sufficient
              balance to complete any transaction on the Balancer Protocol before initiating such
              transaction. You should not take or refrain from taking any action based on any
              information contained on the Site or any other available information at any time.
              Before you make any legal, technical, or financial decisions involving the Services,
              you should seek independent professional advice from a licensed and qualified
              individual in the area for which such advice would be appropriate.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="italic font-semibold">
                You acknowledge and agree that Balancer has no control over any transactions
                conducted through the Balancer Protocol, the method of payment of any transactions
                or any actual payments of transactions including use of any third-party services
                such as Metamask, or other wallet services.
              </span>
              Likewise, you must ensure that you have a sufficient balance of the applicable
              cryptocurrency tokens stored at your Balancer Protocol-compatible wallet address
              (“Cryptocurrency Wallet”) to complete any transaction on the Balancer Protocol or the
              Ethereum network before initiating such transaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              You acknowledge and accept the material potential risks associated with using the
              smart contracts that can be accessed via the Balancer user interface including,
              without limitation, the smart contracts for Balancer Pools. Before using these
              features or Pools, please confirm you understand the functionality and risks. For more

            </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Losses while digital assets are being supplied to the Balancer Protocol and losses
                due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a swapping pair or liquidity pool.
                Prices of digital currencies, tokens and/or other digital assets fluctuate day by
                day or even minute by minute. The value of your available balance could surge or
                drop suddenly. Please note that there is a possibility that the price of tokens
                could decrease to zero. Prices of tokens are prone to significant fluctuations, for
                example, due to announced proposed legislative acts, governmental restrictions, news
                related to cyber crimes or other factors causing potentially excessive market
                enthusiasm, disproportionate loss in confidence, or manipulation by others in the
                market.
              </li>

                Risks associated with accessing the Balancer Protocol through third party web or
                mobile interfaces. You are responsible for doing your own diligence on those
                interfaces to understand and accept the risks that use entails. You are also
                responsible for doing your own diligence on those interfaces to understand and
                accept any fees that those interfaces may charge.
              </li>
              <li>Risks associated with any Smart Contracts with which you interact.</li>
              <li>
                Although Balancer does not have access to your assets, you are reminded and
                acknowledge that at any time, your access to your Cryptocurrency Assets through
                third party wallet services, unrelated to Balancer or the Balancer.Fi website, may
                be suspended or terminated or there may be a delay in your access or use of your
                Cryptocurrency Assets, which may result in the Cryptocurrency Assets diminishing in
                value or you being unable to complete a Smart Contract.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="italic font-semibold">
                  You are reminded of the inherent risks with digital assets and decentralized
                  finance including the fact that tokens are not legal tender and are not backed by
                  any government.
                </span>
                Unlike fiat currencies, which are regulated and backed by local governments and
                central banks, tokens are based only on technology and user consensus, which means
                that in cases of manipulations or market panic, central governments will not take
                any corrective actions or measures to achieve stability, maintain liquidity or
                protect their value. There is a possibility that certain transactions cannot be
                settled or may be difficult to settle, or can be completed only at significantly
                adverse prices depending on the market situation and/or market volume. Transactions
                may be irreversible, and, accordingly, potential losses due to fraudulent or
                accidental transactions are not recoverable. Some blockchain transactions are deemed
                to be completed when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date
                or time when you or another party initiated the transaction.
              </li>
              <li>
                The regulatory frameworks applicable to blockchain transactions in connection with
                tokens are still developing and evolving. It is possible that your transactions or
                funds are, or may be in the future, subject to various reporting, tax or other
                liabilities and obligations. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the
                country or international level may materially and adversely affect the use,
                transfer, exchange, and value of your tokens.
              </li>
              <li>
                The site and/or application may be wholly or partially suspended or terminated for
                any or no reason, which may limit your access to your Cryptocurrency Assets.
              </li>
              <li>
                You are solely responsible for understanding and complying with any and all
