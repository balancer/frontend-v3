                  </em>
                  We do not typically use tracking technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, to
                  collect information about you; however, third parties we rely on may do so.
                  Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that
                  help us improve the UI and your experience, see which areas and features of the UI
                  are popular, and count visits. Web beacons (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear
                  GIFs”) are electronic images that we use on the UI to help deliver cookies, count
                  visits, and understand usage and campaign effectiveness. For more information

                information we have access to or receive, most importantly, from our service
                providers. Your wallet and IP address is accessible to Balancer and its vendor(s).

              <h2>Additional Disclousures for Individuals in Europe</h2>

              <p>
                If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or
                Switzerland, you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the
                processing of your personal data, and this section applies to you.
              </p>
              <h3>Legal Basis for Processing</h3>

              <p>
                Balancer does not typically process user personal data. If Balancer processes data,
                such as a wallet address and certain IP addresses, it will do so in reliance on the
                following lawful bases:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  To perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g., providing
                  access to the UI you requested).
                </li>
                <li>
                  When we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data to operate the
                  UI or protect our interests (e.g., to adhere with applicable laws, rules and
                  regulations, provide, maintain, and improve our products and UI, conduct data
                  analytics, and communicate with you).
                </li>
                <li>To comply with our legal obligations.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Data Retention</h3>

              <p>
                We do not maintain customer accounts or store personal data. Our vendor will store
                your wallet address in order to provide requested services.
              </p>
              <h3>Data Subject Requests</h3>
              <p>
                Subject to certain limitations, you have the right to request access to the personal
                data we hold about you and to receive your data in a portable format, the right to
                ask that your personal data be corrected or erased, and the right to object to, or
                request that we restrict, certain processing. Balancer does not typically hold or
                store such personal data.
